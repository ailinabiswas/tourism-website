            <b>Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, offers a diverse look at the architectural and cultural heritage of West Bengal. While north Kolkata is known for its old mansions, the central business district of Benoy-Badal- Dinesh Bag (Dalhousie Square) is famous for its colonial buildings. Kolkata is the only city in India where the tram still survives. Apart from the Academy of Fine Arts, the city also has a few notable private art galleries. The socio-religious heritage of the city is exemplified by the various temples, mosques and churches in the city. Take a walk along the lively riverfront lying to the west of the city.
            <br><br>Kolkata (Calcutta) was a colonial city. The British East India Company developed Calcutta by establishing an artificial riverine port in the 18th century CE. Kolkata was the capital of the British Indian empire until 1911, when the capital was relocated to Delhi. Kolkata grew rapidly in the 19th century to become the second most important city of the British Indian Empire after London. This was accompanied by the development of a culture that fused Indian philosophies with European tradition. <br>
        Kolkata is also noted for its revolutionary history, ranging from the Indian to the leftist Naxalite and trade-union movements. Labelled the "Cultural Capital of India", "The City of Processions", "The City of Palaces", and the "City of Joy", Kolkata has also been home to prominent statesman and yogis. Problems related to rapid urbanization started to plague Kolkata from the 1930s and the city remains an example of the urbanization challenges of the developing nations.

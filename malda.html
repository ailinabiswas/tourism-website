Pandua, once the alternate seat of power to Gaur, has the third largest concentration of Muslim monuments in Bengal. Historical monuments include the mosque Jami Masjid (1566) and the landmark Nimasari tower across the river. The Malda Museum has a great collection of the regions architectural and anthropological specimens.

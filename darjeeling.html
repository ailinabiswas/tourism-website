    Tucked beneath the snow peaks of Mt Kanchenjunga and enveloped by tea gardens, Darjeeling and its sister cities, Kalimpong and Kurseong, together offer a unique look into the cultural heritage of West Bengal, influenced by the Himalayas, Buddhism and colonial legacy. The colourful monasteries, with their statues, frescoes, thangkas and votive objects are repositories of knowledge and art. The colonial legacy lives on through the tea gardens, home to the ‘champagne of teas’, Darjeeling Tea. Do not miss a ride on the UNESCO World Heritage Train, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway (DHR), popularly known as the Toy Train. Pay a visit to the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) of Darjeeling if you are keen to know about the history of mountaineering in India. <br><br>
Connected to Kolkata via nearest airport Bagdogra, railway station New Jalpaiguri and road transport hub Siliguri, the circuit can be visited round the year though travel may get hampered during the monsoon. <br>
Darjeeling conjures visions of snow peaks, serenity of vibrant green hills steeped in splendour, a land of breathtaking beauty crowned by the majestic Himalayas. Darjeeling is one of the most magnificent hill resorts in the world. This heavenly retreat is bathed in hues of every shade. Flaming red rhododendrons, sparkling white magnolias, miles of undulating hillsides covered with emerald green tea bushes, the exotic forests of silver fir - all under the blanket of a brilliant azure sky dappled with specks of clouds, compellingly confounds Darjeeling as the QUEEN OF HILL STATIONS. The crest of Kanchenjunga shining in the first dawn light truly supports the title. <br><br>
Darjeeling beckons thousands today for a leisurely respite from the bustle of the madding crowd. The traveler - whether a tourist or a trekker, an ornithologist or a photographer, a botanist or an artist - will find in Darjeeling an experience which will remain etched in ones memory - forever.</p>

            <b> Chandannagar was a French colony till 1950 and French is still taught as a third language in many of Chandannagar's schools. The Chandannagar Strand is considered as the most beautiful stretch of the Hooghly and still houses a few French mansions. Just off The Strand, is the Sacred Heart Church, one of the prime attractions of Chandannagar. The church interior has beautiful stained glasses. The Durgacharan Rakshit Ghat on the Strand is an interesting mix of Indo - French architecture. Also on the Strand is the Duplex's Museum, housing a French Museum.

              History of Chandannagar
History of Chandannagar:
        Urbanization of Chandernagore started centering round three localities Khalisani, Boro Kishanganj and Gondalpara. Chandannagar was established as a French colony in 1673, obtaining permission from Ibrahim Khan, the then Nawbab of Bengal, to establish a trading post on the right bank of the river Hooghly.
            It became a permanent French settlement in 1688. In 1730 Joseph francois  Dupleix  was appointed governor of the city. In 1756 war broke out between France and Great Britain, and the British Navy captured Chandannagar on 23 March 1757. Chandernagore was restored to the French in 1763, but recaptured by the British in 1794. The city was returned to France in 1816, along with a 3 sq miles (7.8 km2) enclave of surrounding territory. It was governed as part of French India until 1950, under the political control of the governor-general in Pondicherry, though India became independent of Britain in 1947.
